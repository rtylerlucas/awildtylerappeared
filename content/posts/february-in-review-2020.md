Happy leapt year! February went fast, even with that extra day. Here in Seattle, I find it best to stay busy during the wet weeks. Spend time with friends and family, ski on the weekends, watch movies, read books, write thoughts.

## Highlights of February

- Coffee with an experienced engineer ✅
- Design a T Shirt ✅
- Bi-Weekly Financial Review ❌
  - This was missed. This will happen by necessity when we do our taxes this month. I will say we've been much more budget-friendly since moving into our new apartment (Dropping $1000 in rent every month was a godsend).
- Digital Wellbeing ☀️
  - The latest phone update came with a couple of really handy features. One of them makes it easy to set daily timers for Apps, and forces you off them when those timers expire. I've set timers for IG & FB of 15 minutes each, and it's been fantastic. My phone has some embarassing metrics of days prior to the timers where I spent over an hour on just one of those applications.

### Thoughts

Two goal-oriented months in, I've noticed I've become slightly more attune to the passing of time. I find myself wanting time to slow down, being quite happy where I'm at. I find this feeling much preferable to wanting time to move faster. It means I _like_ where things are, and I'm not looking to arrive anywhere else. It also means I'm a procrastinator. I want time to slow down so that I have more time to do more things. That's probably worth unpacking which is why I'm including it here. Maybe it's because my birthday is coming up (27 on 3/13), maybe it's the beginnings of grey appearing in my beard.
