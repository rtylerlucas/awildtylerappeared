Happy Leap Year. I find it best to stay busy during the wet weeks. Spend time with friends and family to warm up the soul. Go ski on the weekends. Watch movies, read books.

## Highlights of February

- Get coffee with an experienced engineer - I found a mentor!
- Basketball
- Two goal-oriented months in, I've noticed I've become slightly more attune to the passing of time. I find myself wanting time to slow down, being quite happy where I'm at. I find this feeling much preferable to wanting time to move faster. It means I _like_ where things are, and I'm not looking to arrive anywhere else

### Faves from the month

- Parasite
- Oathbringer - I'm sleeping better, is reading this before bed helping??
- Destiny 2
