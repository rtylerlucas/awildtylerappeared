_Write down all the things you don’t like to do or that make you uncomfortable. Especially those things you know are good for you. Now go do one of them, and do it again. Take a photo or video of yourself in the discomfort zone, post it on social media and don’t forget to include the hashtags #discomfortzone #pathofmostresistance #canthurtme #impossibletask._

- Going on a run.
- Working on my blog.
- Making metric dashboards and SLO documentation.
- Reading.
- Yoga.
- Meditating.
- Eating healthy.
- Consistently going to the gym without overdoing it. (I.e: avoiding minor joint injuries - shoulder, knee).
