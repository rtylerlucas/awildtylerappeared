The electrical grid, at first mention, sounds boring. In Monopoly, you often trade away your utility cards for more sexy assets (Boardwalk & Park Place). So why did I want to read and write about this? First I'll try and convince you of the appeal. Perhaps _energy_ sounds less boring. _Renewable_ energy, in particular, bolsters the profile into something you might swipe right on? How about money, big business, societie's backbone, the largest man made sytem in the entire world. Our _future_. These reasons and more spurred me to get my feet wet in the history, workings, and bottlenecks of today's electical grid, here are some takeaways.

This was mostly inspired by Gretchen Bakke's "The Grid".

## How It Was

The American electrical system had a exponentional rise to fame. 

### Taming the beast

1830s - Telegraph
1876 - Telephone
1877 - Phonograph

### Electricity en Mass

1879 - First power grid (San Fransisco)
1896 - Radio
1890 - 
1910 - 
1920 - 
1950 -
It quickly went from novelty to necessisity.

## How It Works

"Electricity is not like anything else. It's not a solid, or a liquid, or a gas. It doesn't move like the wind or tides. It doesn't combust like oil or burn like wood. If it resembles anything at all from the world we know, it is in some way like gravity." Electricity is produced and consumed as soon as it is requested. Once you flip a light switch, some power plant, most likely burning coal, generated, transmitted, and delivered the voltage necessary.

## What the Future Looks Like

The primary bottleneck for renewable energy is _not_ the production of power, but instead the oscillating availability. What do we do if the wind stops blowing or the sun sets for the day? As mentioned, electricity is produced as soon as it's consumed. We do not have a good solution for durable storage of electricty at a national scale.

The future will be mostly microgrids. A handful of college campuses and grid hipsters already operate like this. 

As always, thank you for reading. If you have thoughts on the past, present, or future of electricity, do share.
