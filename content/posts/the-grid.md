The electrical grid, at first mention, sounds boring. In Monopoly, you often trade away your utility cards in favor of more sexy assets (Boardwalk & Park Place). So why the hell did I want to write about something boring? First I'll try and convince you of the appeal. _Energy_, energy sounds less boring. _Renewable_ energy, in particular, bolsters the profile into something you might swipe right on. Money, a dependency of internet, big business, the largest man made sytem in the entire world. Our future. These reasons and more spurred me to get my feet wet in the history, workings, and bottlenecks of today's electical grid, here are some takeaways.

This was mostly inspired by Gretchen Bakke's "The Grid".

## How It Was

The American electrical system had a exponentional rise to fame. 
1890 - 
1910 - 
1920 - 
1950 -
It quickly went from novelty to necessisity. 

## How It Works

Electricity does not flow like water. Electricity is produced and consumed as soon as it is requested. Once you flip a light switch, some power plant, most likely burning coal, generated, transmitted, and delivered the voltage necessary.

## What the Future Looks Like

The primary bottleneck for renewable energy is _not_ the production of power, but instead the oscillating availability. What do we do if the wind stops blowing or the sun sets for the day? As mentioned, electricity is produced as soon as it's consumed. We do not have a good solution for durable storage of electricty at a national scale. 

The future will be mostly microgrids. A handful of college campuses and grid hipsters already operate like this. 

As always, thank you for reading. If you have thoughts on the past, present, or future of electricity, do share.
