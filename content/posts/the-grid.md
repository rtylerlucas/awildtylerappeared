"_Electricity is not like anything else. It's not a solid, or a liquid, or a gas. It doesn't move like the wind or tides. It doesn't combust like oil or burn like wood. If it resembles anything at all from the world we know, it is in some way like gravity._"
Gretchen Bakke, The Grid.

I asked and received Bakke's book for Christmas (thanks mom üôè), curious about something I rely on everyday but know almost nothing about. This post will cover some of the knowledge learned.

## How It Works

Electricity is produced and consumed as soon as it is requested. You flip a light switch, some power plant, most likely burning coal, generates the electricity necessary to power that bulb, instantly.

### Power Plants: as easy as PB&J

1. Heat up some water, causes steam
2. Capture the steam, point at propellor
3. Ensure propellor has magnets on it
4. Run a metal wire through the middle of the propellor
5. Surround the metal-pierced propellor and with a circular metal casing
6. Put a lightbulb on the end of wire, keep heating that water, you have yourself a generator!

You've now made a generator. Metal, magnets, metal sandwich. As easy as making a PB&J. ü•™

This [Video and How Do](http://www.amasci.com/amateur/coilgen.html) is what finally got the concept to stick for me.

Then what happens my bulb is off? Surely the power plant is still heating water?

This one took me a while to wrap my head around, this quora answer helped!

## How It Came To Be

The American electrical system had a exponentional rise to fame. It quickly went from novelty to necessisity. One thing I found relatable

## What the Future Looks Like

My primary takeway from this book? Learning that the bottleneck for 100% renewable energy is _not_ the generation of renewable power, but instead its varietable availability. What do we do if the wind stops blowing or the sun sets for the day? As mentioned, electricity is produced as soon as it's consumed. We do not have a good solution for durable storage of electricty at a national scale.

The future will be mostly microgrids. A handful of college campuses and grid hipsters already operate like this. 

As always, thank you for reading. If you have thoughts on the past, present, or future of electricity, do share.
