March tends to be a nice month for me. It's the month I was born, and it's the first month that's _not_ February, which is by far my least favorite month of the year. The weather has started to turn from doom & gloom to happiness & sunshine. Thank God I'm chipper for Marches, because 03/2020 was decidedidly terrible for the rest of humanity. Jen & I have been working from home for a full month now. Our dogs love it. We continue to learn how to adapt to it.

## Highlights of March

{{< instagram B9pJBVolo4Q hidecaption >}}

### Turned 27 🎉

- Jen surprised me with a mid-week cabin retreat. It was perfect. Work-From-Forest.

### Got promoted! 🎉

- Feels good. Love my team, love the company's mission. I'm grateful to work at a place that can thrive in a recessive economic environment.

### Disassembled PS4 🔏

- Last month's lowlight turned into this month's highlight. Contrasting this month's review with February's makes crystal clear the quality-of-life difference with the distraction tucked away.

### Smaller Wins

**Restrung my guitar** 🎸

- Over a year had past with it missing a string. It took me longer than I'd like to admit... but it's a playable instrument, once again. Now on two step 2: create pleasing sounds with it.

**Built a home office** 🖥

Productivity: 📈 YouTube black holes: 📈

- The first part of the month I spent hunched over my laptop in a budget office chair. My back submitted a formal complaint to management. I orderd a [badass ergonomic chair](https://slickdeals.net/f/13916387-workpro-quantum-9000-mesh-multifunction-ergonomic-mid-back-chair-black-209-tax-free-shipping?src=frontpage), then picked up my mechanical keyboard and monitor from the office. Huge improvements in posture, WPM, and ability to sit for long periods at my desk in attempt to make a difference somehow somewhere.

**Digital Wellbeing** ☀️

- In an effort to minimize the Youtube blackhole, I started agressively clicking "Not Interested" or even "Block Channel" for recommendations on the homepage. This dramatically reduce the homepage scrolling, though I don't think there's a world where scrolling Youtube is very healthy in the first place.

## Lowlights

- No gym, no weights.
  - There is nothing I want more in this world at the moment than a pair of 35lb dumbbells. Sadly, they're out.[¹](#1)
- Too. Much. Internet.
  - Waiting for the code to compile? The muscle-memory of my fingers navigates to Hacker News, The Verge, Tech Crunch, Reddit, Polygon, Kotaku, faster than my monkey brain can process it. Youtube sessions mutate from well-intentioned educational endeavors into lowest-common-denominator mindlessness.[²](#2) If my phone enters my grasp, infinite scrolling ignites over Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit.[³](#3)

## Thoughts

I spent more quality time with friends in March 2020 than any other period in recent memory. Mostly virtual, sometimes in small groups.[⁴](#4) It was lovely. The time together felt more intentional than ever before. We could vent about our fears and frustrations with our reality. To quote Mr. Rogers, anything mentionable is manageable.

## Faves from the month

- Movie: [Bombshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G9-KhBek8)[⁵](#5)
- Music: [Edith Piaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFzViYkZAz4)
- Book: [Goliath Must Fall](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYLUMR8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) (Bible Book)
  - Helps me sleep at night and get up in the morning, particularly with the pandemic afoot.
- Card Game: [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion)
- TV: [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE)
- Cooking: Spring Rolls 😋
  - Super simple, but probably never would have tried if not for our friends' step-by-step instruction. Healthy too.

## Goals for April

Theme: Assemble!

KR 1: Cobble together a piano piece.

- Last month's theme was _music_. I sat down at the piano for the first time in months. It was glorious. I hope to continue this quaran-habit.

KR 2: Master a new meal.

- Adding spring rolls to our arsenal felt empowering.

KR 3: Write about "It Doesn't Take A Hero".

- I've found the only way I can read hard books and get something out of it is to test myself on them. What better way to test than to write about it.

## Footnotes

[¹](#1) "They," being the entirety of the internet.

[²](#2) _I'm looking at you, Architectural Digest!_

[³](#3) Thankfully I have relatively strict timers on my mobile apps (15 minutes each for FB, IG, and Reddit). Still, hitting the limit on each of those every day feel

[⁴](#4) _I understand small groups are a big thumbs down in the Season of Quarantine. We keep our distance, wash hands aggressively, and lift each other's spirits in this incredibly uncertain time.

[⁵](#5) "A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood" was a close second. I, like many, was a skeptic of Mr. Rogers. Highly recommend.
