## Highlights of March

- Turned 27 üéÅ
- Disassembled PS4 üîè
- Restrung my guitar üé∏
  - Over a year had past with it missing a string, collecting dust and regret.
- Built a home office üñ•
- Got promoted! üéâ
  - Feels good. Love my team, still loving Convoy. I'm grateful to work at a company that can thrive in the inflamed economic environment.
- Digital Wellbeing ‚òÄÔ∏è
  - In an effort to minimize the Youtube blackhole, I started agressively clicking "Not Interested" or even "Block Channel" for recommendations on the homepage. This dramatically reduce the homepage scrolling, though I don't think there's a world where scrolling Youtube is very healthy in the first place.

## Lowlights

- No gym, no weights.
  - There is nothing I want more in this world at the moment than a pair of 35lb dumbbells. Sadly, they're out.
- _Too_ much of internet.
  - Waiting for the code to compile? The muscle-memory in my fingers would navigate my attention to Hacker News, The Verge, Tech Crunch, Reddit, Polygon, Kotaku, faster than my brain could keep up with. Youtube sessions would mutate from well-intentioned education sessions into lowest-common-denominator mindlessness. With my phone was in hand, I could start infinitely scrolling Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit without a moment's notice of _why_ I had opened the app in the first place.

### Thoughts

I spent more quality time with friends in March 2020 than any other period in recent memory. Mostly virtual, sometimes in small groups. It was lovely. The time together felt more intentional than ever before. We could vent about our fears and frustrations with our reality. To quote Mr. Rogers, anything mentionable is manageable.

### Faves from the month

- Movie: Bombshell
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G9-KhBek8
- Music: Edith Piaf - La Vie En Rose
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFzViYkZAz4
- Book: Goliath Must Fall (Bible Book)
  - Helps me sleep at night and get up in the morning, particularly with the pandemic afoot.
- Game: Dominion!
  - https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion
- TV: CGP Grey
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE
- Cooking: Spring Rolls üòã
  - Super simple, but probably never would have tried if not for our friends' step-by-step instruction. Healthy too.

### Goals for April

Theme: Assemble!

- KR 1: Cobble together a piano piece.
  - Last month's theme was _music_. I sat down at the piano for the first time in months. It was glorious. I hope to continue this quaran-habit.

- KR 2: Master a new meal.
  - Adding spring rolls to our arsenal felt empowering.

- KR 3: Write about "It Doesn't Take A Hero".
  - I've found the only way I can read hard books and get something out of it is to test myself on them. What better way to test than to write about it.

Footnotes

[1] "They," being the entirety of the internet.

[2] Thankfully I have relatively strict timers on my mobile apps (15 minutes each for FB, IG, and Reddit). Still, hitting the limit on each of those every day feels bad.

[3] "A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood" was a close second. I, like many, was a skeptic of Mr. Rogers. Highly recommend.
