## Highlights of March

- Turned 27 ✅
- Disassembled PS4 ✅
- Restrung my guitar ✅
  - Over a year had past with it missing a string, collecting dust and regret.
- Built a home office ✅
- Got promoted! ✅
  - Feels good. Love my team, still loving Convoy. I'm grateful to work at a company that can thrive in the inflamed economic environment.

## Lowlights

- No gym, no weights
  - There is nothing I want more in this world at the moment than a pair of 35lb dumbbells. Sadly, they're out.

### Thoughts

I spent more quality time with friends in March 2020 than any other period in recent memory. Mostly virtual, sometimes in very small groups.

### Faves from the month

- Movie: Bombshell
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G9-KhBek8
- Music: Edith Piaf - La Vie En Rose
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFzViYkZAz4
- Book: Goliath Must Fall (Bible Book)
  - Helps me sleep at night and get up in the morning, particularly with the pandemic afoot.
- Game: Dominion!
  - https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion
- TV: CGP Grey
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE
- Cooking: Spring Rolls 😋
  - Super simple, but probably never would have tried if not for our friends' step-by-step instruction. Healthy too.

### Goals for April

Theme: Assemble!

- KR 1: Cobble together a piano piece.
  - Last month's theme was _music_. I sat down at the piano for the first time in months. It was glorious. I hope to continue this quaran-habit.

- KR 2: Master a new meal.
  - Adding spring rolls to our arsenal felt empowering.

- KR 3: Write about "It Doesn't Take A Hero".
  - I've found the only way I can read hard books and get something out of it is to test myself on them. What better way to test than to write about it.
