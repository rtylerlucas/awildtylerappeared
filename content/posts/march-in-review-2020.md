March tends to be a nice month for me. It's the month I was born, and it's the first month that's _not_ February, which is by far my least favorite month of the year. The weather has started to turn from doom & gloom to happiness & sunshine. Thank God I'm chipper for Marches, because 03/2020 was decidedidly terrible for the rest of humanity. Jen & I have been working from home for a full month now. Our dogs love it. We continue to learn how to adapt to it.

## Highlights of March

### Turned 27 🎉

- Jen surprised me with a mid-week cabin retreat. It was perfect. Work-From-Forest.

### Got promoted! 🎉

- Feels good. Love my team, love the company's mission. I'm grateful to work at a place that can thrive in a recessive economic environment.

### Disassembled PS4 🔏

- Last month's lowlight turned into this month's highlight. Contrasting this month's review with February's makes crystal clear the quality-of-life difference with the distraction tucked away.

### Smaller Wins

**Restrung my guitar** 🎸

- Over a year had past with it missing a string. It took me longer than I'd like to admit... but it's a playable instrument, once again. Now on two step 2: create pleasing sounds with it.

**Built a home office** 🖥

Productivity: 📈 YouTube black holes: 📈

- The first part of the month I spent hunched over my laptop in a budget office chair. My back submitted a formal complaint to management. I orderd a [badass ergonomic chair](https://slickdeals.net/f/13916387-workpro-quantum-9000-mesh-multifunction-ergonomic-mid-back-chair-black-209-tax-free-shipping?src=frontpage), then picked up my mechanical keyboard and monitor from the office. Huge improvements in posture, WPM, and ability to sit for long periods at my desk in attempt to make a difference somehow somewhere.

**Digital Wellbeing** ☀️

- In an effort to minimize the Youtube blackhole, I started agressively clicking "Not Interested" or even "Block Channel" for recommendations on the homepage. This dramatically reduce the homepage scrolling, though I don't think there's a world where scrolling Youtube is very healthy in the first place.

## Lowlights

- No gym, no weights.
  - There is nothing I want more in this world at the moment than a pair of 35lb dumbbells. Sadly, they're out.[¹](#1)
- Too. Much. Internet.
  - Waiting for the code to compile? The muscle-memory of my fingers navigates to Hacker News, The Verge, Tech Crunch, Reddit, Polygon, Kotaku, faster than my monkey brain can process it. Youtube sessions mutate from well-intentioned educational endeavors into lowest-common-denominator mindlessness.[²](#2) If my phone enters my grasp, infinite scrolling ignites over Instagram, Facebook, and Reddit.[³](#3)

## Thoughts

I spent more quality time with friends in March 2020 than any other period in recent memory. Mostly virtual, sometimes in small groups.[⁴](#4) It was lovely. The time together felt more intentional than ever before. We vented our fears and frustrations with our reality. We celebrated the small stuff. We talked. To quote Fred Rogers, "Anything that's human is mentionable, and anything that is mentionable can be more manageable. When we can talk about our feelings, they become less overwhelming, less upsetting, and less scary."

## Faves from the month

- Movie: [Bombshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G9-KhBek8)[⁵](#5)
- Music: [Marshmello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A57B7B6w3kw)
- Book: [Goliath Must Fall](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYLUMR8/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) (Bible Book)
  - Helps me sleep at night and get up in the morning, particularly with the pandemic afoot.
- Card Game: [Dominion](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion)
- TV: [CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE)
- Cooking: Spring Rolls 😋
  - Super simple, but probably never would have tried if not for our friends' step-by-step instruction. Healthy too.

## Goals for April

Theme: Assemble!

KR 1: Cobble together a piano piece.

- Last month's theme was _music_. I sat down at the piano for the first time in months. It was glorious. I hope to continue this quaran-habit.

KR 2: Master a new meal.

- Adding spring rolls to our arsenal felt empowering.

KR 3: Write about "It Doesn't Take A Hero".

- I've found the only way I can read hard books and get something out of it is to test myself on them. What better way to test than to write about it.

## Footnotes

[¹](#1) "They," being the entirety of the internet.

[²](#2) _I'm looking at you, Architectural Digest!_

[³](#3) Thankfully I have relatively strict timers on my mobile apps (15 minutes each for FB, IG, and Reddit). Still, hitting the limit on each of those every day feel

[⁴](#4) _I understand small groups are a big thumbs down in the Season of Quarantine. We keep our distance, wash hands aggressively, and lift each other's spirits in this incredibly uncertain time.

[⁵](#5) "A Beautiful Day in The Neighborhood" was a close second. I, like many, was a skeptic of Mr. Rogers. Highly recommend.
