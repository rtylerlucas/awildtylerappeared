### 2019 - The Best We Could Do

Last year I wrote a personal review of the year prior, with goals set going into 2019.

My 2019 goals were quite humble. (Play piano, meditate, write, etc)<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>[^¹]. If I were to pick a theme for last year's goals, it would be *sustainability*. I was coming off a strong 2018. I had just started a new job @ Convoy. The goals were focused on building healthy habits that could last a lifetime. Some were achieved, some in partial capacity, and some not at all.

2020's goals are more incremental. For starters, they are not annual, but monthly.

My 2020 goals are targeted more toward outcomes and less toward routines. This is not to discredit the power of habit, far from it. I'm a huge believer in ([Queue => Routine => Reward](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12609433-the-power-of-habit)).

I've found setting explicit goals against habits sometimes takes away from the benefits those habits invoke. I do not need an annual goal of brushing my teeth 730 times a year, for example. The only reason I brush my teeth is to maintain a healthy smile. If my goal was 730 brushes, perhaps I knock all 730 out in Q1; my teeth proceed to deteriorate the rest of the year. Or maybe the opposite - Q3 rolls around and I've only brushed a couple dozen times. I would be hard pressed to even attempt to reach 730, knowing how far I am from the target.

The goal should be the raison d'etre, not the means. Lofty goals, simple steps.

## Goals

### Goals in January 2020

How does it look?

Goal: Build a healthy website. I see the personal website as a gateway for improvement in several avenues of life. Creative, social, professional[²](#2).

### (1) Launch a Personal Timeline feature on this site

I love the idea of a succinct timeline view of major events in someone's life. It's the story we tell ourselves, through whatever lense fits. LinkedIn is one example, is a timeline scoped to your professional career. [Here](https://www.dkthehuman.com/about/) is more 'personal life timeline' example that I enjoy.

### (2) Make a 'Top Ten' post

'Top Ten' is a simple pattern that turns a topic into something easy to read, write, and talk about. I'm setting the bar quite low here - all the more reason to #GetShitDone. Some potential topics of mine:

- Documentaries
- Vegan Meals
- Movies involving Time Travel
- Celebrity Role Models

### (3) Make a post about the Electrical Grid, Survivorship, and Self Sustainability

I am nearly done with 'The Grid', by Gretchen Bakke.
