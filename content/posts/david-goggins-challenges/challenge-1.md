_What are the current factors limiting your growth and success? Write them out in minute detail. Don’t be bland with this assignment. I showed you every piece of my dirty laundry. You will use your story, this list of excuses, these very good reasons why you shouldn’t amount to a damn thing, to fuel your ultimate success. What are the long-odds you are up against right now? Are you standing in your own way? Use hashtags #badhand #canthurtme_

- **No strong male role model.** Dad died young. Mom's dad is a sociopath. Father's father was good to me (took me back-to-school shopping every year), but had his own limits that led him to avoid any conversation rising past the knee.
- **Financial disadvantage.** Mom never went to college. Lived paycheck to paycheck. No playbook for financial, spiritual, or emotional success. That's not to say she wasn't a great mom - She was the best. She dedicated her life to **me**, investing all her time and resources so that I could be successful. She raised me in a loving home with tons of community, opportunity, and grit. She pushed me to do well in school (even though she didn't) and taught me how to care for everyone in the room. She sowed a deep seed of positivity, built to shine bright, especially in the face of adversity. But she's in her mid-50s, and has no plan for retirement. It is a burden and a motivator, all in one.
- **Too comfortable.** I got real comfortable after my early 20s. Graduated college, got a stable job, moving far from home, and got married. I stopped _needing_ to push myself. Too much distraction, too much entertainment, little will power to avoid it. Why would I? Things are good. If things stayed exactly like this for the rest of my life, it would be far from bad. Other than financial independence, I don't know what to shoot for, so take my foot off the gas.
