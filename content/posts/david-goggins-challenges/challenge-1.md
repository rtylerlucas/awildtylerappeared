What are the current factors limiting your growth and success? Break out your journal and write them all out in minute detail. Don’t be bland with this assignment. I showed you every piece of my dirty laundry. You will use your story, this list of excuses, these very good reasons why you shouldn’t amount to a damn thing, to fuel your ultimate success. What are the long-odds you are up against right now? Are you standing in your own way? Use hashtags #badhand #canthurtme

- Dad died young. Mother's father is a sociopath. Father's father was good to me (took me back-to-school shopping every year), but suffered limits of his own that made him avoid any conversation that rose past the knee. No strong male role model.
- Mom never went to college. Lived paycheck to paycheck. No playbook for financial, spiritual, or emotional success. That's not to say she wasn't a great mom - She dedicated her life to **me**, investing all her time and resources so that I could be successful. She raised me in a loving home with tons of community, opportunity, and grit. She pushed me to do well in school (even though she didn't) and taught me how to care for everyone in the room. She sowed a deep seed of positivity that shines particularly bright in the face of adversity. Yet the older we get, the more our similarities drift. She is a Facebook-sharing Fox News enthusiest. I am a card-carrying member of the Andrew Yang gang. She's told me she would not take the vaccine once released, at least not right away. She thinks mega-pharmacudical companies have cures for cancer, but don't share it to make more money. I've developed a huge interest in combating conspiracy theory, mostly so I have a utility belt of reasoning anytime we interact. She is in her mid-50s and has no plan for retirement.
- I got real comfortable after graduating college, moving to Seattle, and getting married. I stopped _needing_ to push myself.
- Quarentine makes it hard to stay fit. Hard to do deep work.
- Too many distractions, too much entertainment, little will power to avoid it. Why would I? Things are good. If things stayed exactly like this for the rest of my life, it would be far from bad, it would be considered a really good life.
