_Write down all the things you don’t like to do or that make you uncomfortable. Especially those things you know are good for you. Now go do one of them, and do it again. Take a photo or video of yourself in the discomfort zone, post it on social media and don’t forget to include the hashtags #discomfortzone #pathofmostresistance #canthurtme #impossibletask._
