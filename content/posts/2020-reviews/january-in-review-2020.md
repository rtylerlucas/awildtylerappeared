### Why Set Goals

My little brother came to visit this month. While waiting in line for Ramen, (a must on the Lucas agenda), He commented that "I was very goaly." After swiftly correcting him that I was more of a midfielder, he got me thinking, why set goals? Why change? I think goal setting helps bring to focus the things you _really_ want out of life: the things you want to achieve, the person you'd like to be. Eyeing goals helps lift your head above the short-lived distractions that surround our day-to-day life.

## Objectives of January: In Review

Objective: Build a healthy website

- KR 1: Make an IG Scheduler ✅
  - I spent roughly (2) hours trying to make an automated IG scheduler leveraging sketchy open-source libraries accessing private APIs by impersonating an Android phone. (Instagram does not have public APIs readily available). Upon executing my sketchy API requests, the responses from Instagram's servers were, "hey these requests look fishy, please 2FA". Even when 2FAing manually, I was never able to get past the front gate. So I simplified, instead of an automated scheduler, I have a schedule in my head. A post a week, typically a photo from my weekends (Fri, Sat, Sun) posted Monday mornings. I tried it out the past few weeks and it's working great. Honestly this approach is arguably more robust than my original, as in covers the entire funnel, rather than harping only on the deployment piece.[¹](#1)
- KR 2: Make a Top 10 Post ✅
  - I made 2! These were a joy to make and play quite nicely into this month's objective. I plan to extend these as my favorites rotate, including a change log to capture the shift in preference over time.
    - [Documentaries](https://awildtylerappeared/posts/documentaries/)
    - [Time Travel Movies](https://awildtylerappeared/posts/time-travel-movies/)
- KR 3: Write about the electrical grid ⚠️
  - This was _really_ hard for me to sit down and write. My procrastination on this particular KR is the reason January's review is published halfway through February. This delay tactic was personally maddening, so I'm claiming a powerful lesson learned here: Complete the KR by month's end, or call it missed, and move on. Failure is a _good_ thing. Be honest, call out what exactly failed and why. Learn from it. Compare my enthusiasm for this KR with the two above it, I think the reason for this failure becomes clear. The oscars just wrapped up, and in delivering his acceptance speech for Best Director, Bong Joon-Ho quotes Scorsese with: "The most personal is the most creative." This KR wasn't personal. Fun facts are not sustaining, it's got to be more than that.
    - All that said, I did it, here it is: [The Grid](https://www.awildtylerappeared.com/posts/the-grid/)

## Objectives for February

Objective: Be intentional.

I've heard that while goals often fail, themes tend to stick. This month I'd like to be more thoughtful with how I spend my time, my attention, my emotions, and my resources. This one is broad, but that's _intentional_.

- KR 1: Be there for Jen as she explore's Ada's Developer Academy.
  - My wonderful wife is dipping her toes in code. While she has no clue if this is something she wants long term, it's an interesting avenue she at least wants to consider. I want to be there for her as she steps her way through it.
- KR 2: Craft a Tee for my Team @ Convoy.
  - I hold great honor in my (self-appointed) title of T-Shirt Chair. It's been designing shirts for groups for as long as I can remember. In high school I made shirts for French Club, Cross Country, and SGA. I made some trendy tank tops for #theboys of Spring Break. In College, I designed several shirts celebrating Fraternity events. As an adult, I spent an excessive amount of time crafting our intermural soccer jerseys (Westeros FC). At Coupang, I designed a PSG-inspired tee[²](#2). I'd like to ignite the furnace once more, crafting a mighty top for my fellow Convoyagers.
- KR 3: Clean up YNAB, schedule a monthly family review.
  - I own an app called "You Need A Budget" that I often fail to leverage. I think this failure comes from a lack of accountability. I've heard of strategies that publish their entire financials to the internet, using friends and strangers as a sound board. I'm not quite comfortable enough for that, so I'll start with the audience of Jen, Koda, and Eevee, and go from there. Budgeting shines a light on where you _spent_ and where you _will spend_ your money, sounds pretty intentional to me.
- KR 4: Restring classical guitar.
  - It's been over a year since I've invested this, I miss it, but the barrier-to-play is high right now, because it requires an initial investment of re-stringing the instrument. Setting a goal here to set me up for success in #MusicMarch.
- KR 5: 50% Completion of: "It Doesn't Take A Hero"

## Footnotes

[¹](#1) _It looks like you can get access to Instagram's private APIs if you convert your account to a 'Professional or Creator'. Perhaps I'll try that somewhere down the road._

[²](#2) _The Coupang PSG Shirt sadly never got made, I left the company prior to execution. This was one of my bests, perhaps I can re-work the design to be leveraged somewhere else._
