## Thoughts

October went by mighty fast. Jen & I invested lots of time and attention into the home. We became well-acquianted with the art of pursuing "quotes." Tree guys, fence guys, crawlspace guys, retaining wall guys. Multiple quotes from each category.

The new WFH setup took some getting used to. The 3 hour time difference between Atlanta and Seattle required more acclimation than anticipated. That said, my WFH space transitioned from a nook by the kitchen to an entire room... with its own door! My focus has improved dramatically with the extra space for peace and quiet.

By the end of October I felt well-adjusted to our new day-to-day. Jen & I started going to the gym frequently (in off-hours to avoid the crowds). We've noticed welomed improvements in endurance and physique. We eat lots of donuts though, so those improvements are modest. ðŸ˜„

Acquiring furniture has been an undertaking. Lots of outlets and lots of scrolling. By November though, we have most everything accounted for. (The couches being the most challenging and the now most rewarding).

We celebrated Halloween with a small group of our Atlanta friends which was a blast. The next day I learned the hard way how reliant I am on rest. Mastering the art of the nap is an underappreciated skill that I plan to pursue more passionately going forward.
