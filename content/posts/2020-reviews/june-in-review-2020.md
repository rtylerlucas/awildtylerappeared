## Highlights of June

<!--  -->

### Black Lives Matter ‚úäüèæ

- Neither mom nor dad went to college. Parents divorced when I was 1. Dad died when I was 15. Mom lives paycheck to paycheck. Despite these events, or maybe even because of them, I've been moderately successful. Until recently, I've tallied my successes as a reflection of my perseverance. The more I look back, however, the more I realize how much privilage paved my path. I am a white male who grew up in the deep south. I've had doors open for me that were walls for someone else, strictly because of the color of skin. I've been present for countless conversations where one group was put down so that another could maintain. I've gone through life with a chip on my shoulder. I'm grateful for the this realization, but there's a long way to go. I strongly believe growth hurts. I expect tectonic-level shifts in our society, and I'll do what I can to advocate for that, even if it hurts.

### On Jokes ü§ê

- A big thing I've learned recently is the subversive power of a joke. Growing up, people would say whatever they could to get someone else to laugh, even if the cost of laughter was at the expense of someone else. This was true for friends, family, and most certainly myself. And countless times those expenses are written off as, "...Relax! It's only a joke!". What I've come to realize is those expenses are only painless if you're not the one paying them. Look, laughing is awesome. Making someone else laugh is equally awesome, perhaps even more so. We have to be better. We can't laugh, or make someone else laugh, if the cost of duing business is paid by someone else.

### Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've been running more and more. God it feels good. It's become a form of therapy for me. Most times that I do, I think about Ahmaud Arbery. Running is such a peaceful activity for me, I can't imagine what it's like to be scared for your life while you do it.

## Lowlights

- No-go on moving to ATL (for now)
- Jen's recurring UTI :(
- Pandemic
- My office is in my kitchen. My gym is in my bedroom.

## Goals for July

I am trying _really hard_ to figure out what the hell I would do with my time if I retired today. I am a decade (or two) off from retirement, but with quarantine, privilage, hard work, and luck, I've found the venn-diagram of being retired and being a remote employee have substantial overlap; an excess of freetime with very few people to spend it with. So I _reallyyy_ want to know, what does a fullfilling retirement look like for me? How does it differ from an entertaining one? How is it the same?

My theme this month is to be less sarcastic, and more loving.
