## Highlights of June

{{< instagram B_dNt0mF61s >}}

### Black Lives Matter ✊🏾

- Convoy's take
- CHAZ
  - Friend's and Families' perspective from the news VS the peaceful place next door

### Running 🏃‍♂️

Running more and more. Everytime I do, I think about Ahmaud Arbery. Running is such a peaceful activity for me, I can't imagine what it's like to be scared for your life while you do it.

## Lowlights

- No-go on moving to ATL (for now)

## Thoughts

The idea of repressed anger manifesting in physical ways.
