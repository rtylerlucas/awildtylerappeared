## Goals for August

Fill out every David Goggins Challenge as soon as you come across it in his book. I've already completed Challenge #1 here.

Modify my Hugo template to support category tabbing.

Use my GoPro 2 times.

My theme for August will be the same as July: less sarcastic, more loving and forgiving.
