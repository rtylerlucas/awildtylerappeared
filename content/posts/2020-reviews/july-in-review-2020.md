## Goals for August

1. Fill out every David Goggins Challenge as soon as you come across it in his book. I've already completed [Challenge #1 here](https://www.awildtylerappeared.com/posts/challenges/challenge-1/).

2. Modify my Hugo template to support category tabbing.
   - [Here is a repo](https://github.com/rvanhorn/hugo-dynamic-tabs#:~:text=Hugo%20Dynamic%20Tabs%20uses%20two,individual%20tab%20within%20that%20group.) that will lead me on the right track

3. Use my GoPro 2 times.

4. My themes for August will be the same as July: less sarcastic, more loving & forgiving.
