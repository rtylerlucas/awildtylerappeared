April was a month of sunshine and organization.

## Highlights of April

<!--  -->

### Lucas House Budget üéâ

I finally took the time to learn a framework for [financial budgeting](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). I cannot overstate how enlightening this has been. To be frank, I've half-assed this in the past, never really investing the time or attention it deserves. Budgeting broke down some long-held illusions of gradure for me: financial independence, or at the very least, one million dollars[¬π](#1), by the age of 30.

This long-held dream motivated me to work hard in school. I was determined to never have to worry about money as an adult. I assumed that the combination of my all lucky breaks in life, (debt-free college education, beautiful, intelligent, caring wife, six-figure income), combined with some vanilla savings profile (maxed annual 401k & IRA contributions), plus a sprinkling of savings on top, that I could breeze through my 20s and hit this lofty goal relatively scot-free.

This was dillusional!

I think, deep down, I've known it for the past couple years. I think I just didn't want to admit it. So rather than face the truth, I basically kept busy. Long story short, I feel empowered coming to terms with my financial _reality_. I understand the increasing improbability of reaching my first financial goal in life. But who gets it right on their first try? I have new goals in mind, this time with plans on how exactly I can achieve them.

### Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've been running more. I ran a lot in school, but fell off as a young professional. It got to the point where even a short jog up the hill would push me out of breath. Weightlifting was my biggest loss transitioning into quarantine. Running became a natural replacement. I started short and slow, but quickly ramped up speed and distance[¬≤](#2). In April I completed a loop all the way around South Lake Union. It was hard, and took longer than I'd have liked, but it was an achievement. I'm now looking for races to join once quarantine ends.

### Smaller Wins

**Standing Desk** üñ•

- Splurged on a powerful frame, attached it to my favorite tabletop(2), and volia! This thing brings so much joy. I feel a huge boost in what I am able to get done in the day since investing in this thing; it's been worth every penny[¬≥](#3).‚ù§Ô∏è

**Budgeting with Mom**  üíµ

- This was a *big* small win. I was able to take all my personal learnings about finances and share it with mom. The advent of Zoom made this easier than ever before. Screensharing combined with the relaxed environment made this arguably effective than in person. It made me really happy to do this together. It should help clear up several unknowns for the both of us[‚Å¥](#4).

**Digital Wellbeing** ‚òÄÔ∏è

- BlockSite is an app on my phone and browser that's saved days of my life. March was filled with zombie-scrolling. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, and pop-tech sites. I've blocked all of these but YouTube, but writing this out makes it clear YT is next on the list. The hardest part is this: these were my breaks from work. Breaks are important. I need to find something healthy to replace them with, and that I still don't have a clear answer for.

## Lowlights

- Snacks üçø
  - I was snacking a lot in April. My shiny desk is only a couple footsteps from the fridge. Running helped offset this somewhat, but I'd like to be smarter about my snack intake. I downloaded MyFitnessPal; it helped a little but comes with lots of overhead.

- Work randomization üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  - Quarantine randomizes even the most organized of teams. Ours feels compounded. At one point in April, I was attending 3 different team stand-ups in attempt to align my work with their contributors. I was also the solo oncall for location at Convoy. It became a bit of treading water. It didn't feel like I was innovating, mainly because I didn't have time for it. Juggling operations load (metrics, alarms, bugs, service upgrades, security vulnerabilities, and other one-off requests), left me little room to move the needle on quarterly OKRs. It bothered me enough that I'll be dedicating energy over the next month to fix it. I want to learn how to innovate while remote. I want to be a one-man army: maintain a highly reliable, maintainable, scalable ecosystem while still spending 50-60% bringing new features to the trucking industry.

## Thoughts

My KRs for April were boring to me -  I feel like I didn't go after them much.

## Goals for May

Theme: Embrace the Pig üê∑. Whatever I do in May, I want to fully embrace the process. I want to be pig-headed about it. Embrace the boredom, the pain, the monotony, the suffering... whatever it is, acknowledge the collection of feelings that come along with it, and continue. Embrace it. Eat it and be present üê∑

KR 1: Plan Jen's Birthday Gift

KR 2: Meditation each morning.

KR 3: Personal OKRs for work.

## Footnotes

[¬π](#1) _To be read in Dr. Evil voice._

[¬≤](#2) _It was really cool to see my accelleration in progress, I attribute this to my ~6 years of competitive running before hand._

[¬≥](#3) _2 years ago I found a metal tabletop propped against the wall of our old apartment, staged for recycling. I loved the design (white marble) and the price (0$). I picked it up, wiped it down, and loved it ever since. Now it's been upgraded._

[‚Å¥](#4) _I have a lot more thoughts here. I think it's worth another post or two, and ideally, spawns some tooling I can share to help others. These thoughts intertwine with my recent understanding of how conspiratorial thoughts can ever come to rise._ [America's Forgotten Working Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEy-xTbcr2A_)
