## Thoughts

It's hard to believe November 2020 has come and gone. Why am I so frequently surprised by the passing of time? Who's to say. November in Georgia was beautiful. Cool but sunny. A pleasant contrast to the early fog that starts settling over Seattle around this time of year.

We hosted a small Friendsgiving with our Atlanta crew. Fried turkey _and_ honeybaked ham. ðŸ¤¤ Our friend group is much smaller than it was in Washington, but thankfully the Atlanta friends we have are exceptional.

Jen & I took a quick trip to Disney World with her parents the week before Thanksgiving. From beginning to end, the trip was a delight. There were lots of laughs, some thrilling rides, some especially wonderful meals, and plenty of quality time with close family. It was a healthy detatchment from the normal grind.

The park was at 25% capacity and masks were requried at all times. Wait times were low. Adjacent rows on rides were left empty. No shows. Most rides were open, but modified in some way to reduce proximity to one another. A unique take on the Disney experience. The roadtrip itself was fun too. Batman (Jen's dad) drove its entirety, leaving lots of time to read, write, play, and think.

I'm glad we can pull off a united family thanksgiving. Another restful long weekend spent with people we care about.

## On Goals

You may have noticed I stopped writing so diligently about personal goals and checklists. Part of this is spurred by the business of homeownership. I've had plenty of short-term, worthwhile goals to keep myself preoccupied. One of the roadtrip activities Jen facilitated was reviewing our "Enneagrams." For the uninitiated, Enneagram is a personality test that prescribes individuals a number between 1 and 9. I've been exposed to these in the past, bristling at the idea of hard labels for personality types. I started to realize, though, that even if it's all make believe, it's a tool for reflection. Reflection, I find valuable (clearly... personal blog). So I gave the enneagrams a go, and discovered my personality most closely matches a "3".

### What's a 3

According to the enneagram book we had on hand ("A Path Between Us"), "3s" are achievement-oriented. They spend most of their headspace thinking about the future. Work is often the center of their life. They sometimes shift their personality to what they think best fits their environment. This often leads to trust issues in a relationship, as they feel unclear which "them" their partner loves, fearing their partner may not love all of parts. They get anxious at times, and try and outrun that feeling by staying endless occupied. These were the bits and pieces I pulled from memory, though several pieces I disagreed with and forgot. All that said, several things resonated. Some parts of the label I really like (#GetShitDone personality âœ…), and other parts made me question myself. (chameleon-like, endlessly pre-occupied).

So rather than listing 6 golden checkboxes for the month, I figure I'd take it easy. Taking it easy is difficult. Being bored, napping, not trying to people-please; these are all things I'd like pursue more. Investing in more soulful activities may help multiply these pursuits. Investing in the moment. JOMO, not FOMO.
