## Highlights of April

{{< instagram B_dNt0mF61s >}}

### Atlanta 🍑

Jen and I flew to Atlanta for a week in the middle of May.

- Stayed with our close friends in the heart of downtown.
- Played 3 matches of tennis with Jen's parents.
- Took a long walk through Emory campus with my mom and her dog.
- Toured 7 homes

### Work 💪

- One man army. Successfully made progress in *both* innovation *and* operation. I moved the needle on some of our team's quarterly KRs while at the same time paid off critical tech debt for some of our core services.
