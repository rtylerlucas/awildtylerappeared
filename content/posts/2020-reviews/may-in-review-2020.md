May was a month of motivation.

## Highlights of May

<!--  -->

### Atlanta üçë

Jen and I flew to Atlanta for a week in the middle of May.

- Stayed with our close friends in the heart of downtown.
- Played 3 matches of tennis with Jen's parents.
- Took a long walk through Emory campus with my mom and her dog.
- Toured 7 homes

A constant point of disagreement for Jen & I over the past couple years has been where we will settle down. The debate has mostly centered on Seattle vs Atlanta, with some pipe-dream sprinkling of Seoul, Berlin, London and SF. I've historically argued for staying in Seattle, highlighting the mountains, the water, and the job opportunity. Jen's been on the Atlanta-side, shining light on family and housing prices. Quarentine brought this conversation to the forefront with lots of healthy back-and-forth. One good thing that's come from this pandemic is it's proved the feasability of going full-time remote. With that in mind, I've acquiesced. Atlanta is growing. I'm excited about the idea of moving back, starting something new and reconnecting with the old. I've submited a request to my boss to move to Atlanta and work remote fulltime. Fingers crossed. ü§û

### Work üí™

- One man army. Successfully made progress in *both* innovation *and* operation. I moved the needle on some of our team's quarterly KRs while at the same time paid off critical tech debt for some of our core services.

### Tennis üéæ

- Lots of tennis in May. I really missed this sort of activity in quarentine.
