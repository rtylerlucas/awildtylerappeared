This is published a few months late, it's been a busy fall. 😅

## Highlights of September

## Thoughts

We moved in 9/25/20. It's now two months later and still feels like a dream. Jen & I bought a house in Brookhaven, GA. The pandemic created a unique path for us to pursue. We both continue to work remotely for Seattle-based companies, but now we have the added benefit of building a nest together in Georgia. Lots of lessons learned (and dollars spent) in the home-buying process. The house is a refreshing change of scenary from our 800sqft apartment in Capitol Hill.

The two things we miss most are friends and nature. We developed a handful of stellar friendships in Seattle. It's been bittersweet not seeing them as often. The mountains, lakes, rivers, and ocean are also sorely missed. That said, everything is a plane ride away.
