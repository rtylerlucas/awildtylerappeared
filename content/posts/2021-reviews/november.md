## Thoughts

I worked hard (nights and weekends) October through November to reach a tight deadline I set for myself. I delivered and feel great now. There were moments in development I wasn't sure if I could reach it and felt much less great. I set the deadline for the beginning of Thanksgiving week so I could unwind after. This was possibly the most code I've ever written in a one month period.
