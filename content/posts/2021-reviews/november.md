## Thoughts

I worked hard (nights and weekends) October through November to reach a tight deadline. The deadline I set for myself and publicized amongst my team. I delivered and feel great now. I built something impressive that solves a real problem. The dopamine from this is long-lasting.

This was possibly the most code I've ever written in a one month period. There were moments of doubt during development that felt _much less_ great. The biggest moments of doubt were when I became unexpectedly blocked due to some dependency. It took real brainpower to set aside the blocked activity and move on to something else while waiting for someone to get back to me. There were countless small moments of prioritization, trade-off, and risk performed on the fly. It's the type of work that's exhilarating in the morning but terrifying in the evening. I'd look at the clock and wonder how the day had come and gone.

So the strategy worked:
1. Set an aggressive date
2. Tell people about it (nothing motivates like peer pressure)
3. Deliver and win

It'd be nice if I could take 10% off the gas while maintaining high speeds indefinitely. Business is a marathon after all, not a sprint. For some reason though, burst mode is extremely effective.
