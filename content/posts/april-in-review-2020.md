April was a month of sunshine and organization.

## Highlights of April

### Lucas House Budget üéâ

I finally took the time to learn a framework for [financial budgeting](https://www.youneedabudget.com/). I cannot overstate how enlightening this has been. To be frank, I've half-assed this in the past, never really investing the time or attention it so notably deserves. Budgeting broke down some long-held illusions of gradure for me: financial independence, or at the very least, one million dollars[¬π](#1), by the age of 30.

This long-held dream motivated me to work hard in school. I was determined to never have to worry about money as an adult. I assumed that the combination of my all lucky breaks in life, (debt-free college education, beautiful, intelligent, caring wife, six-figure income), combined with some vanilla savings profile (maxed annual 401k & IRA contributions), plus a sprinkling of savings on top, that I could breeze through my 20s and hit this lofty goal relatively scot-free.

This was dillusional!

I think, deep down, I've known it for the past couple years. I think I just didn't want to admit it. So rather than face the truth, I basically kept busy. Long story short, I feel empowered coming to terms with my financial _reality_. I understand the increasing improbability of my very first financial goal in life. But who gets it right on their first try? I have new goals in mind, this time with plans on how exactly I can achieve them.

### Running üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've been running more. I ran a lot in school, but fell off as a young professional. It got to the point where even a short jog up the hill would push me out of breath. Fitness was my biggest loss transitioning into quarantine. Running is a natural replacement. I started short and slow, but quickly ramped up speed and distance[¬π](#1). In April I completed a loop all the way around South Lake Union. It was hard, and took longer than I'd have liked, but it was an achievement. I'm now looking for races to join once quarantine ends.

### Smaller Wins

**Standing Desk** üñ•

- Splurged on a powerful frame, attached it to my favorite tabletop(2), and volia! This thing brings a lot of joy. ‚ù§Ô∏è

**Budgeting with Mom**  üíµ

- This was a *big* small win. I was able to take all my personal learnings about finances and share it with mom. The advent of Zoom made this easier than ever before. Screensharing combined with the relaxed environment made this arguably effective than in person. It made me really happy to do this together. It should help clear up several unknowns for the both of us.

**Digital Wellbeing** ‚òÄÔ∏è

- BlockSite is an app on my phone and browser that's saved days of my life. March was filled with zombie-scrolling. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, YouTube, and pop-tech sites. I've blocked all of these but YouTube, but writing this out makes it clear YT is next on the list. The hardest part is this: these were my breaks from work. Breaks are important. I need to find something healthy to replace them with, and that I still don't have a clear answer for.

## Lowlights

- Snacks üçø
  - I was snacking a lot in April. My shiny desk is only a couple footsteps from the fridge. Running offset this somewhat, but I'd like to be smarter about the snack intake. I downloaded MyFitnessPal; it helped a little but comes with lots of overhead.

- Work randomization üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
  - Quarantine randomizes even the most organized of teams. Ours feels compounded. I attended 3 different team stand-ups in attempt to align my work with their contributors. I was also the sole oncall for location at Convoy. It's been a bit of treading water. It doesn't feel like I'm innovating, mainly because I don't have time for it, juggling the operations load (metrics, alarms, bugs, and one-off requests). It's got to me a little in the last week, enough that I'm looking forward to changing it. I want to learn how to be innovative while remote. I want to be a one-man army. Someone how can maintain a healthy ship while still innovating towards new horizons.

## Thoughts

My KRs for April were boring to me -  I feel like I didn't go after them much.

## Footnotes

[¬π](#1) __ To be read in Dr. Evil voice.

[¬π](#1) __ It was really cool to see my accelleration in progress, I attribute this to my ~6 years of competitive running before hand.

[¬≤](#2) __ _I have a lot more thoughts here. I think it's worth another post or two, and ideally, spawns some tooling I can share to help others. These thoughts intertwine with my recent understanding of how conspiratorial thoughts can ever come to rise. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEy-xTbcr2A_

[¬≥](#3) __ _2 years ago I found a metal tabletop propped against the wall of our old apartment, staged for recycling. I loved the design (white marble) and the price (0$). I picked it up, wiped it down, and loved it ever since. Now it's been upgraded._
