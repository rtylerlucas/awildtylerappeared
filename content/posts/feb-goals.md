Happy Leap Year! February 2020 is 38% complete. I often feel February is the most difficult month to bare in the Pacific Northwest. It's cold, It's dark, and it's been cold and dark for as long as you can remember. At the office, there are bi-weekly jokes made about how much we miss that bright yellow ball globe on the horizon. (Better to laugh than cry). I find it best to stay busy during the wet weeks. Spend time with friends and family to warm up the soul. Go ski on the weekends. Watch movies, read books.

In this post I'll cover my goals for February, but first, some highlights from last month.

### Why Set Goals

My little brother came to visit this month. He made the comment that "I was very goaly." After swiftly correcting him that I was more of a midfielder, he got me thinking, why set goals? Why change? I think goal setting helps bring focus to the things you _really_ want out of life, lifting your head above the distractions that surround you every day.

## Objectives of January: In Review

Objective: Build a healthy website

- KR 1: Make an IG Scheduler ✅
  - I spent roughly (2) hours trying to make an automated IG scheduler leveraging sketchy open-source libraries accessing private APIs by impersonating an Android phone. (Instagram does not have public APIs readily available). Upon executing my sketchy API requests, the responses from Instagram's servers were, "hey these requests look fishy, please 2FA". Even when 2FAing manually, I was never able to get past the front gate. So I simplified, instead of an automated scheduler, I have a schedule in my head. A post a week, typically a photo from my weekends (Fri, Sat, Sun) posted Monday mornings. I tried it out the past few weeks and it's working great. Honestly this approach is arguably more robust than my original, as in covers the entire funnel, rather than harping only on the deployment piece.[¹](#1)
- KR 2: Make a Top 10 Post ✅
  - I made 2! These were a joy to make and play quite nicely into this month's objective. I plan to extend these as my favorites rotate, including a change log to capture the shift in preference over time.
    - [Documentaries](https://awildtylerappeared/posts/documentaries/)
    - [Time Travel Movies](https://awildtylerappeared/posts/time-travel-movies/)
- KR 3: Write about the electrical grid ⚠️ / ✅
  - This was _really_ hard for me to sit down and write. My procrastination on this particular KR is the reason February's goals are published halfway through the month. I found this delay tactic rather frustrating, so I'm marking a good lesson learned here: Complete the KR by month's end, or call it missed, and move on. Failure is a _good_ thing. Be honest, call out what exactly failed and why. Learn from it. Compare my enthusiasm for this KR with the two above it, I think the reason for this failure becomes clear. The oscars just wrapped up, and in delivering his acceptance speech for Best Director, Bong Joon-Ho quotes Scorsese with: "The most personal is the most creative." This KR wasn't personal. Fun facts are not sustaining, it's got to be more than that.
    - All that said, I did it, here it is: [The Grid](https://awildtylerappeared/posts/the-grid/)

## Objectives for February

Objective: Be intentional.

I've heard that while goals often fail, themes tend to stick. This month I'd like to be more thoughtful with how I spend my time, my attention, my emotions, and my resources. This one is broad, but that's _intentional_.

- KR 1: Be there for Jen as she explore's Ada's Developer Academy.
  - My wonderful wife is dipping her toes in code. While she has no clue if this is something she wants long term, it's an interesting avenue she at least wants to consider. I want to be there for her as she steps her way through it.
- KR 2: Craft a Tee for my Team @ Convoy.
  - I hold great honor in my (self-appointed) title of T-Shirt Chair. It's been this way for as long as I can remember. In high school, I designed the French Club, Cross Country, and SGA T Shirts. For Spring Break, I made some trendy tank tops. In College, I made several shirts celebrating Fraternity events. As an adult, I spent an exuberant amount of time crafting our Westeros FC soccer jerseys. At Coupang, I designed a tee inspired by PSG[²](#2). It's time to ignite the furnace once more. I'll craft a mighty top for Convoyagers. Something they can wear to battle - protecting from bugs, security vulnerabilities, and 3rd party dependency outages.
- KR 2: Clean up YNAB, schedule a bi-weekly family review.
  - I own an app called "You Need A Budget" that I often fail to leverage. I think this failure comes from a lack of accountability. I've heard of strategies that publish their entire financials to the internet, using friends and strangers as a sound board. I'm not quite comfortable enough for that, so I'll start with the audience of Jen, Koda, and Eevee, and go from there. Budgeting shines a light on where you _spent_ and where you _will spend_ your money, sounds pretty intentional to me.

## A tout à l'heure

Thank you very much for reading. Stay classy.

## Footnotes

[¹](#1) _It looks like you can get access to Instagram's private APIs if you convert your account to a 'Professional or Creator'. Perhaps I'll try that somewhere down the road._

[²](#2) _The Coupang PSG Shirt sadly never got made, I left the company prior to execution. This was one of my bests, perhaps I can re-work the design to be leveraged somewhere else._
