Welcome to my freshly minted website. This post covers highlights from the past year as well as my goal-setting strategem going in to 2020.

## Highlights of January

- Whistler

- Little brother visit

- Parent's in town

- A Gentleman in Moscow, 1917, Mrs. Maisel S3

## Lowlights of January

### January Goals

During his visit, my younger brother claimed I was very 'goaly' (I swiftly corrected him that I was a midfielder). It did make me ask myself, though, why be so goal-oriented? Why change? Are you unhappy with your current self?

## Goals for February

My theme for this month is _organization_. I'd like to get more organized in my budgeting, trip planning, and time allocation.

1. Clean up YNAB, bi-weekly review with spouse

2. Plan a Group Ski Day at a local mountain one Saturday or Sunday

3. Craft a T Shirt for our Org @ Convoy.
