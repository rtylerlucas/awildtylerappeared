Jen and I flew to Atlanta for a week in the middle of May.

- Stayed with our close friends in the heart of downtown.
- Played 3 matches of tennis with Jen's parents.
- Took a long walk through Emory campus with my mom and her dog.
- Toured 7 homes

### Work 🏃‍♂️

- One man army. Successfully made progress in *both* innovation *and* operation. I moved the needle on some of our team's quarterly KRs while at the same time paid off critical tech debt for some of our core services.

### Crossfit 🏃‍♂️

KR 2: Meditation each morning.

KR 3: Personal OKRs for work.

## Footnotes

[¹](#1) __ To be read in Dr. Evil voice.

[¹](#1) __ It was really cool to see my accelleration in progress, I attribute this to my ~6 years of competitive running before hand.

[²](#2) __ _I have a lot more thoughts here. I think it's worth another post or two, and ideally, spawns some tooling I can share to help others. These thoughts intertwine with my recent understanding of how conspiratorial thoughts can ever come to rise. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEy-xTbcr2A_

[³](#3) __ _2 years ago I found a metal tabletop propped against the wall of our old apartment, staged for recycling. I loved the design (white marble) and the price (0$). I picked it up, wiped it down, and loved it ever since. Now it's been upgraded._
